>    PHP provides support for the HTTP PUT method used by clients such
    as Netscape Composer and W3C Amaya.  PUT requests are much simpler
    than a file upload and they look something like this:

    <DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>PUT /path/filename.html HTTP/1.1
    </PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
>
   </P
><P
>    This would normally mean that the remote client would like to save
    the content that follows as: /path/filename.html in your web tree.
    It is obviously not a good idea for Apache or PHP to automatically
    let everybody overwrite any files in your web tree.  So, to handle
    such a request you have to first tell your web server that you
    want a certain PHP script to handle the request.  In Apache you do
    this with the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Script</I
> directive.  It can be
    placed almost anywhere in your Apache configuration file.  A
    common place is inside a &lt;Directory&gt; block or perhaps inside
    a &lt;Virtualhost&gt; block.  A line like this would do the trick:

    <DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>Script PUT /put.php3
    </PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
>
   </P
><P
>    This tells Apache to send all PUT requests for URIs that match the
    context in which you put this line to the put.php3 script.  This
    assumes, of course, that you have PHP enabled for the .php3
    extension and PHP is active.
   </P
><P
>    Inside your put.php3 file you would then do something like this:
   </P
><P
>    <DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&lt;? copy($PHP_UPLOADED_FILE_NAME,$DOCUMENT_ROOT.$REQUEST_URI); ?&gt;
    </PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
>
   </P
><P
>    This would copy the file to the location requested by the remote
    client.  You would probably want to perform some checks and/or
    authenticate the user before performing this file copy.  The only
    trick here is that when PHP sees a PUT-method request it stores
    the uploaded file in a temporary file just like those handled bu the
    <A
HREF="features.file-upload.html#FEATURES.FILE-UPLOAD.POST-METHOD"
>POST-method</A
>.
    When the request ends, this temporary file is deleted.  So, your PUT
    handling PHP script has to copy that file somewhere.  The filename
    of this temporary file is in the $PHP_PUT_FILENAME variable, and
    you can see the suggested destination filename in the $REQUEST_URI
    (may vary on non-Apache web servers).  This destination filename is
    the one that the remote client specified.  You do not have to listen
    to this client.  You could, for example, copy all uploaded files to
    a special uploads directory.</P
